DESCRIPTION
=================================================================
The fineale toolkit is a companion of the book

   Thermal and Stress Analysis with the  Finite Element Method

published online (2014) with Lulu.com.

The fineale toolkit and PDF versions of the book are
distributed as open-source from

    https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEALE
    ========================================

The toolkit includes finite element tools for linear steady-state and 
transient thermal analysis and linear static, transient or modal stress 
analysis. Also included are some examples of geometrically nonlinear 
analysis, including buckling, and material-nonlinear analysis (plasticity).

The finite elements include linear and quadratic triangles and
tetrahedra, linear to cubic quadrangles and hexahedra, and of 
course linear to cubic curve elements. 

The author appreciates feedback and interaction/collaboration. 
Please don't hesitate to e-mail pkrysl@ucsd.edu.

Enjoy!

These are the contributors to the toolkit FAESOR  which was the source
for the current toolkit (alphabetically):

USAGE
=================================================================
To use, type "fineale_init" at the Matlab prompt (your working 
directory must be the folder where fineale_init() resides).
It is also possible to start by running the batch file
start.bat (assuming Windows XP or Windows 7): double-click it.

To get started with fineale, explore the "examples" directory. Each 
simulation has its own script/function file. There is no graphical user 
interface that can be used to run the simulations: They are executed 
as regular Matlab scripts/functions.

The toolkit comes with a suite of tutorials (over 30 as of December 2013). 
Use the command "doc fineale"  and follow the "tutorials" link. The 
tutorials themselves are published Matlab functions or scripts, 
and the published versions are included in the distribution of the toolkit.

The verification suite of the toolkit consists of the directories
listed in the function run_verification(). 

Help is available, just type help fineale (or, doc fineale).

COMPATIBILITY NOTES
=================================================================
The toolkit itself is pure Matlab, developed in its current form 
with various versions of Matlab (see below). 

The executable for the automatic generator of triangle
meshes is at this point distributed only for 
–Windows (computer==PCWIN: XP, Vista), 
–Intel-based Mac (computer==MACI), and 
–Linux (computer==GLNX86); 
however, the generator may be built from the sources, since it too 
is open-source (http://hogwarts.ucsd.edu/~pkrysl/software.html).
